Why do I need Zod?"

Fail Fast: Mongoose only errors when you try to save to the DB. Zod catches the error immediately when the request hits your server. This saves resources.

Sanitization: Zod can clean data (like trimming spaces) before your code even touches it.

Type Safety: Zod integrates with TypeScript to ensure your API inputs exactly match your expectations
